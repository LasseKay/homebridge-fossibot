# Homebridge FossiBot Integration plugin

This Plugin is still in development, you can use it to test the first implementation of an lightbulb for switching AC Output.

In the next few weeks, depends on my freetime, i will add all native BrightEMS features as Accessories.

to implement:
- AC/DC/USB as outlets
- BatteryService for capacity, AC/DC input watts, AC/DC output watts, usage times
- custom characteristics for device settings
- Some stuff for automations (basics like turn of AC outlet if output is <100w and if possible advanced ones like turn of all outputs if there is 100w more output than input for longer than 15mins)

feel free to request or implement different features
